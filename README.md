# DiabeticRetinoPathyDetection
This repository contains the code and details of our project for diabetic retinopathy detection using deep learning architectures.

## How to Implement Our Code on Your Dataset
1. Firstly, you have to apply the pre-processing steps to make the subtle features visible and conspicuous. The mathematical and other required details are mentioned in the research article; however, just for the sake of implementation, you can use [MATLAB_Related_Files](https://github.com/ImranNust/DiabeticRetinoPathyDetection/tree/main/MATLAB_Related_Files) to get the enhanced version.
